# Movie Review Poll App
 
A program database to view upcoming movies and share movies reviews.
In order to write movie reviews you need to create a user that then allows you to read all the films you've reviewed.

After reading other movie reviews, the user can then open the trailer to make up their mind as to whether it's worth watching.

After sharing movie reviews the user can then vote on movie polls, such as best director or best film of the year. The results can then be loaded as a pie graph.
